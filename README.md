# NetworkTweakV6 - Magisk Module

A comprehensive network optimization module for Android devices using Magisk, designed to improve internet connectivity, reduce ping, and enhance overall network performance.

## üìã Description

NetworkTweakV6 is a Magisk module that applies various network tweaks and optimizations to Android devices. It combines Google DNS (8.8.8.8) and Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1) configurations with advanced TCP/IP optimizations, iptables rules, and system property modifications to deliver better internet performance.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Advanced Audio Features**: TWS+ support, split A2DP, and frame control optimizations

### üîß System Optimizations
- **Kernel Parameters**: Direct kernel network parameter tuning via /proc/sys
- **iptables Rules**: Smart DNS redirection using iptables DNAT rules
- **Property Injection**: System property modifications for network behavior

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### Installation Process (`install.sh`)
1. Displays installation information and changelog
2. Extracts module files to the Magisk module directory
3. Sets appropriate permissions for all files
4. Configures the module for automatic execution

### Boot-time Initialization (`post-fs-data.sh`)
- Executes during Android's post-fs-data phase
- Sets DNS properties for all network interfaces
- Configures IPv6 DNS settings
- Modifies `/system/etc/resolv.conf` if it exists

### Runtime Service (`service.sh`)
- Runs during late_start service mode
- Implements iptables DNS redirection rules
- **Key Improvements in V6**:
  - Unified DNS IP (1.1.1.1) for both TCP and UDP traffic
  - Removes old rules before adding new ones to prevent duplication
  - Uses `-I` (insert) option for higher priority rules
  - Cleaner code with better logging

### System Properties (`system.prop`)
- **Internet Tweaks**: TCP buffer sizes for various connection types
- **Wireless & TCP Optimizations**: Core network parameters
- **DNS Settings**: Comprehensive DNS configuration
- **Signal Tweaks**: Mobile network optimizations
- **Audio Enhancements**: 
  - Bluetooth codec optimizations (aptX, aptX HD, LDAC, AAC)
  - Call voice quality improvements (AMR wideband)
  - Advanced audio features (TWS+, A2DP splitting)

### Kernel Tweaks (`netspeed`)
- Direct kernel parameter modification
- TCP timestamp, window scaling, and SACK optimizations
- Memory buffer fine-tuning
- Connection timeout optimizations

## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Rooted Android device
- Magisk installed and working
- Magisk Manager or similar module management app

### Installation Steps
1. Download the NetworkTweakV6 module ZIP file
2. Open Magisk Manager
3. Go to Modules section
4. Tap "Install from storage"
5. Select the downloaded ZIP file
6. Reboot your device

## üîÑ Changelog - Version 6 Improvements

The following improvements have been applied to `service.sh`:

1. **Unified IP for TCP & UDP**: Both TCP and UDP DNS traffic are now directed to 1.1.1.1, simplifying configuration and improving efficiency
2. **Removed old rules before adding new ones**: Existing iptables DNAT rules for port 53 in the OUTPUT chain are cleared first to prevent duplication
3. **Inserted new rules with higher priority**: New iptables rules use the `-I` (insert) option to ensure they're placed at the top of the chain
4. **Removed unnecessary functions and variables**: Script is now more concise, eliminating separate TCP/UDP variables and rule-check functions
5. **Added logging**: Log messages are displayed when iptables rules are applied, making monitoring and debugging easier

**Result**: The script is now more efficient, cleaner, and less prone to rule duplication.

## üéØ Expected Benefits

- **Lower Ping**: Reduced latency through DNS and routing optimizations
- **Faster Connection**: Improved connection establishment and data transfer
- **Better Stability**: More stable network connections across different network types
- **Enhanced Audio Quality**: 
  - Higher quality Bluetooth audio with premium codecs (aptX HD, LDAC)
  - Clearer voice calls with AMR wideband
  - Better wireless audio device compatibility
- **Improved Coverage**: Better mobile signal reception and network selection
